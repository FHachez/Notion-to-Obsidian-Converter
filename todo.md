-   [ ]Fix issue with linked db that are repeated... I've got the concept db and reading list db repeated a lot, a lot! In total I got 222 683 links... in the csv...
    -   I don't need these csv files!
-   [ ] Let's rename folders and remove the numbers from the file name ?
    -   How do we manage conflicts? Add a number? What about the references?
-   I've got 4499 markdown link!!
-   Let's build an index of the sub-notes (for example for the concept db). Either we list it ourselve or we use the csv and format the name...
